# Smart Document Router

The Smart Document Router ingests unstructured docs into ERPs from faxes, email, and other ERPs. It peels off streams of docs that can be processed autonomously with LLMs and NLP - reducing the need for time-consuming, expensive manual workflows.

The Document Router is designed with a human-in-the-loop and can processes financial data correctly ‘on the nose’. (We are not doing RAG!)

Tech stack:
* NextJS, NextAuth, MaterialUI, TailwindCSS
  * Future:
* FastAPI

* Pydantic
* Future: OpenAI, Anthropic, LLama3...
